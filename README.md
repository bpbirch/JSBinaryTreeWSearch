# JSBinaryTreeWSearch
This module/repo contains a class-based BinaryTree structure. Included in this class are traversal, search, and get methods. Search and get use the traversal methods as arguments, and the results of these searches are actually achieved by changing the state of static variables within BinaryTree.
